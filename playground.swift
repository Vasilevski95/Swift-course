//This is a variable that can be reassigned, when declared with var

//Arrays are ordered and they have indexes to determine placement of the elements

//Sets:

/*Sets are unordered, and they cant have duplicate values
The good thing about sets is their performance and speed
They have faster insertion, removal and lockup */

you must go through each item, for sets it doesent matter how much items do you have

//Functions:

/*
 Functions are contained of parameters that come after the name () and function scope {}

1.Iterate over a collection

A class can inherit methods, properties, and other characteristics from another class.

//struct:

/*
Structs are more lightweight and performant than classes, because they are value types.
Difference between reference types and value types:
Classes are reference types and structs are value types.
Reference types (classes) point to the specific set of data.
Value types (structs) copy that data and it's its own instance when you create a new one
in life example: You can think of a reference type like a google sheet that you share with people.
Now, if you change something in that sheet, everyone will see the difference.
Value type is like when you create an excel spreadsheet and then send it to everyone.
Now that file becomes their own and they can change it, but your file remains unchanged.
